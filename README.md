# 🎬 Netflix Landing Page Clone

A pixel-perfect **Netflix India landing page clone** built using **HTML5 and CSS3**. This project demonstrates strong frontend fundamentals by recreating a real-world, production-level interface with attention to layout, typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy.

Built to showcase the ability to convert design concepts into functional web pages while following modern development practices.

## 🚀 Why This Project Stands Out

* Recreates a globally recognized platform interface
* Demonstrates strong understanding of **semantic HTML**
* Shows proficiency in **modern CSS layout techniques (Flexbox, positioning, overlays)**
* Clean and scalable code structure
* Focused on real-world UI replication rather than beginner tutorials
* Highlights attention to detail — an essential frontend engineering skill

This project reflects readiness to contribute to professional frontend projects and development teams.
